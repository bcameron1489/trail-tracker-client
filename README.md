Unsolved Problems :
  If you were to look at my previous commits you would see that I originally started this project with the front end framework ember.  However, between the numerous issues I was having (linux compatibility issues, server issues, time constraints, all coupled with the general lack of knowledge that comes with learning a new framework) and the amount of time I had already lost, I decided to put ember on the back burner and restart from scratch with a js template.  I look forward to approaching this project with ember in the future and with more time to figure out the issues I was having in my linux terminal (Ember server would only work like 10% of the time and would often hang or freeze my laptop when making changes in my text editor).
